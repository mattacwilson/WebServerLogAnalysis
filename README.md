# WebServerLogAnalysis
Final task for Computer Programming for my HNC in Cyber Security. 

The task:

You are required to collect the IP addresses that occur in the log and count the frequency
at which they appear. Your program must report which IP address appears most frequently
in the log. You will be required to make use of non-trivial data structures and built-in
Python sorting and/or searching functionalities. You are required to make use of functions,
parameter passing, and return values in your program.


Included with the .py file are the sample logs for the application to work.
